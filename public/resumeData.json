    "description": "Front-end engineer fluent in React, Figma, and the occasional coffee overdose. I turn vague ideas into clean, usable interfaces and make it look easy. Big fan of UX, design systems, and pixel-perfect drama. On weekends, I swap code for cameras—capturing stories through photography and short films. Basically, part engineer, part artist, and full-time involved with problems—mostly making them, occasionally solving them..",
